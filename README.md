# bilos-calendar
Create a simple web app, using Laravel 8/9 for backend and NuxtJS (Vue) for frontend, that can add and override events to a calendar. Save the event to a MySQL table. The app needs to be on a single page and build the frontend using CUSTOM CSS AND NATIVE JS ONLY. (STRICTLY NO PLUGIN FOR CALENDAR)

Date computation should be on the FRONTEND.
